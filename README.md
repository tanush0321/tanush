this is my vityarthi project code and screenshots which are attached with my github repository

this School Fee CRUD Manager allows administrators to edit,update,add or delete any students name details and more for college admission purpose or for college tution and hostel fees purpose
in my code of School Fee CRUD Manager there is add,update,delete,edit student name reg no. and payment all these options are there in my code.
the only thing i do all these things in my code is by using looping sysytem and conditional statements there is no use of def function and any other function majorly
it is very user friendly understandable code which is easy to understand.
