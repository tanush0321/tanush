my name is tanush chaddha registartion number 25BSA10031
branch computer science with cloud computing and automation 
this is my vityarthi project code and screenshots which are attached with my github repository
project name is School Fee CRUD Manager
this School Fee CRUD Manager allows administrators to edit,update,add or delete any students name details and more for college admission purpose or for college tution and hostel fees purpose
in my code of School Fee CRUD Manager there is add,update,delete,edit student name reg no. and payment all these options are there in my code.
the only thing i do all these things in my code is by using looping sysytem and conditional statements there is no use of def function and any other function majorly
it is very user friendly understandable code which is easy to understand.

for this code first i import json and os for saving the files from code
i also used oops concept of saving the file details for read or read and write only depends on the code
then i inistialize the while loop inside which all the code has writtern
and for user to choose that to add a student name or delete or update for that menu i used conditional statements
like if elif and else statements.
for each code like to add a student i used if elif and else commands to operate them so if user chooses 1 option then 
python will ask the reg number,name,grade and fees of that student to add in server 

and to save files i initialize opps concept of save and read the date in file after every block of code which is there in menu of my CRUD sysytem

there are total 7 things in menu in my CRUD system which all are followed by conditional statemnts inside while loop.
